We are a **brand-new lab** at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu), starting in **July 2025**, affiliated with the [Department of Cancer Biology](https://www.upenn.edu/cancer-biology) and the [Center for Cellular Immunotherapies](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cci/).

Our focus is to **understand and engineer the genetic machinery of immune cells**, with the ultimate goal of improving cellular immunotherapies for cancer and other diseases.

### Scientific Approaches

We are excited to explore and engineer immune cell biology through:

### Technology Development

A large part of our work is the development of new technologies for immune cell engineering. We are especially focused on the development of **high throughput methods** that allow us to **design and measure many different genetic modifications in parallel**.
