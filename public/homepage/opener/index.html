Our focus is to understand and engineer the genetic machinery of immune cells, with the ultimate goal of improving cellular immunotherapies for cancer and other diseases.
Scientific Approaches We are excited to explore and engineer immune cell biology through:
Protein Engineering Designing new receptors, transcription factors, and other proteins to rewire cellular behavior Functional Genomics Understanding cellular signaling networks and their regulation Synthetic Biology Designing and testing new genetic circuits and regulatory elements Technology Development A large part of our work is the development of new technologies for immune cell engineering. We are especially focused on the development of high throughput methods that allow us to design and measure many different genetic modifications in parallel.">
